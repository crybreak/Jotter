Over the past few months, I've been working on an extremely complex solution to advance towards the level of senior iOS developer. My approach involved using the Zettelkasten method to create a notebook similar to Apple's, offering the ability to manage data persistently and synchronize it via iCloud. Features include note-taking, organization by folders and subfolders, deletion, text formatting, adding images, sharing via WhatsApp, Teams, Discord, adding tags, saving to Finder, and syncing on iPad, iPhone (iOS), and macOS. Technologies used include Swift, UIKit, Combine, Core Data, SwiftUI, Drag and Drop, among others.

The Zettelkasten is a note-taking system developed by a German social scientist, Niklas Luhmann. Luhmann published an insane amount of books and scientific articles.

His trick: the Zettelkasten. It's an archive of notes (Zettelkasten being the German word for filing cabinet). Luhmann had over 80,000 notes in his cabinet by the end. To retrieve information, he used an index register and linked notes to other notes, thus creating a chain of thoughts. Thus, following a series of notes is like following a series of thoughts. You can interact with the Zettelkasten as if it were your second brain.

Archiving and linking all these notes on paper must have been a colossal task. Fortunately, we will build our own version of the Zettelkasten: a digital filing cabinet.
